# Aurelio AI Philosophy

We wanted to create a list of materials that we could point to for onboarding new team members at [Aurelio AI](https://aurelio.ai/). The reason we call it our **philosophy** is because this is not just a list of tools that our team must learn to work with us. Instead, it is that and more. It covers how we're approaching building our company, team, and projects.
